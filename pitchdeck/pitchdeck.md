## Slide 5: How It Works (Mechanism Design)
- **Step 1:** User submits a legal query (case type, jurisdiction, description).
- **Step 2:** Miners (legal AI models) analyze and return summary + references + recommendations.
- **Step 3:** Validators verify reference accuracy against legal databases and case law.
- **Step 4:** Quality scores computed; $TAO rewards distributed proportionally.
- **Step 5:** All interactions recorded on-chain for transparency and audit trail.
- **Diagram:** Flow: Query -> Miners -> Analysis -> Validators -> Score -> Reward.

## Slide 6: Miner & Validator Design
- **Miner Tasks:**
  - Legal question analysis and categorization
  - Generate advice with statute/case law references
  - Jurisdiction-specific compliance checks
  - Performance metric: Reference Accuracy, Relevance Score
- **Validator Tasks:**
  - Verify cited statutes and case law exist and are current
  - Cross-reference with legal databases (case law, regulations)
  - Scoring formula: `Score = 0.5 * RefAccuracy + 0.3 * Relevance + 0.2 * Completeness`
- **Image:** Miner/Validator role diagram.

## Slide 7: Bittensor Integration & Incentives
- Runs as a dedicated Bittensor subnet.
- Miner Reward: `alpha * AdviceQuality * QueryReward`
- Validator Reward: `beta * ValidationScore * TotalReward`
- Staking mechanism for validator trust.
- On-chain reputation tracks long-term accuracy per jurisdiction.
